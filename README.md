# 🌀 MazeAI

MazeAI is a C# console application that generates a random maze and finds solutions using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. It visualizes the maze and the solutions in the console.

## 🎉 Motivation

This project was created for fun and to learn more about the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the MazeAI application, follow these steps:

1. 📁 Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. 🖥️ Open the solution file (`MazeAI.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. ⚙️ Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.
4. ▶️ Run the application by pressing `Ctrl + F5` or selecting the "Start Without Debugging" option.

## ✨ Features

- 🏗️ Generates a random maze using a depth-first search algorithm.
- 🔄 Finds all possible solutions from the starting point to the ending point using recursive backtracking.
- 👁️ Visualizes the maze and the solutions in the console.
- ⏱️ Measures the execution time of the DFS and BFS algorithms.
- 📏 Prints the shortest and longest solutions found by the algorithms.

## 📖 Usage

The application will generate a random maze and display it in the console. It will then find all possible solutions and print them out. Finally, it will run a test using both DFS and BFS algorithms and display the execution time for each algorithm. The shortest and longest solutions will also be printed.
